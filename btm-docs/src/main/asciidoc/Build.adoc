[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

You need to have these softwares installed to be able to build BTM:

* GIT
* JDK 17+

[[source]]
== Getting the Source

The project uses GIT as it's source code control system.
The source can be checked out anonymously using:

    git clone https://github.com/pythys/bitronix

[[building]]
== Building

The project uses Apache Maven 2 as it's build tool.
Go to the top level directory of the project and type:

    mvn install

This will build BTM locally, run tests, build javadoc and install the generated artifacts in your local repository.

[[ide]]
== IDE Integration

Because BTM supports JDBC3 and JDBC4 at the same time, setting up an IDE in a way that there are no errors can be "tricky".  See these links for an example of how an IDE can be configured.
